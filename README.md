# Laboratory task 10
## Create a closed doubly-linked list with resistors data
### List of typical operations for data structure management:
 - adding an item to the list, 
 - searching for an item by key, 
 - outputting item data, 
 - removing an item from the list, 
 - removing all items from the list, 
 - deleting the list,
### Individual task:
 - adding an element in ascending order of the brand and value of the resistor,
 - output of all resistors, the accuracy of which is not worse than specified
